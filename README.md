# Hair-salon-app
Work in progress: This repository is actively being developed, with updates and improvements added regularly. This endeavor, which commenced with initial code in a local virtual environment, will progressively receive updates and be uploaded to the GitHub repository.

It has two main purposes: to practice modern and interesting technologies like Python, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy, and to serve as a practical solution for a hair salon's appointment management system. The goal is to evolve it into a robust web application. While the current implementation uses SQLAlchemy for the database, I plan to incorporate MongoDB functionality in the future, among other things. Additionally, a collaborator will be participating in the development of this project, contributing to its growth and success.
