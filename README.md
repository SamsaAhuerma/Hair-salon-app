# Hair-salon-app
Work in progress: This repository is actively being developed, with updates and improvements added regularly. This endeavor, which commenced with initial code in a local virtual environment, will progressively receive updates and be uploaded to the GitHub repository.

It has two main purposes: to practice modern and interesting technologies like Python, FastAPI, and MongoDB, and to serve as a practical solution for a hair salon's appointment management system. The goal is to evolve it into a robust web application. We are starting with a basic schema and will gradually implement more complex functionalities in the future. Additionally, there will be collaborators participating in the development of this project, contributing to its growth and success.

Developers:

Samsa Ahuerma, Nicolas Xynos, Renzo Condormango

P.S.: Please be patient with this repo, as we are both working and studying. ü§ç
