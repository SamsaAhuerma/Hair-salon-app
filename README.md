# Hair-salon-app
Work in progress: This repository is actively being developed, with updates and improvements added regularly. This endeavor, which commenced with initial code in a local virtual environment, will progressively receive updates and be uploaded to the GitHub repository.

It has two main purposes: to practice modern and interesting technologies like Python, FastAPI, and MongoDB, and to confront and gain practical experience with real-world problems through the development of a hair salon's appointment management system. The goal is to evolve it into a robust web application. We are starting with a basic schema and will gradually implement more complex functionalities in the future. Additionally, there will be collaborators participating in the development of this project, contributing to its growth and success.
