# Hair-salon-app
Work in progress: This repository is actively being developed, with updates and improvements added regularly. This endeavor, which commenced with initial code in a local virtual environment, will progressively receive updates and be uploaded to the GitHub repository.

It has two main purposes: to practice modern and interesting technologies like Python, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy, and to serve as a practical solution for a hair salon's appointment management system. The goal is to evolve it into a robust web application. While the current implementation uses SQLAlchemy for the database, we plan to incorporate MongoDB functionality in the future, among other things. Additionally, there will be collaborators participating in the development of this project, contributing to its growth and success.

Developers:

Samsa Ahuerma, Nicolas Xynos, Renzo Condormango

P.S.: Please be patient with this repo, as we are both working and studying. ü§ç
