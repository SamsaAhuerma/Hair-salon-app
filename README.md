# Hair-salon-app

Work in progress: This repository is actively being developed, with updates and improvements added regularly. This endeavor, which commenced with initial code in a local virtual environment, will progressively receive updates and be uploaded to the GitHub repository.

It has two main purposes: to practice modern and interesting technologies like Python, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy, and to serve as a practical solution for my sister's business. Initially, it is designed as an appointment management system for a hair salon, but the goal is to evolve it into a robust web application. While the current implementation uses SQLAlchemy for the database, I plan to incorporate MongoDB functionality in the future, among other things.
